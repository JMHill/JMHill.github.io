Hi! My name is Justin Hill and I am an educational technology professional and web development student in Alexandria, VA. Although I am currently self-taught (through online courses with [Treehouse][treehouse], [Code School][codeschool], and whatever else I can find), my goal is to refine my skills.

My dream is to utilize emergent educational technologies to develop alternatives to traditional schooling that arm students with the skills necessary to help build a free, peaceful, and creative society. If you'd like to follow me on my journey, check me out on twitter or feel free to contact me.
