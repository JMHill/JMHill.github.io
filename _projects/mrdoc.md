This project began as a first attempt at applying some of the skills I had learned in my Thinkful node.js course. While working at my day job with an education-focused philanthropy, I found that several of my colleagues worked on a team that had some very unique workflows related to accepting research requests from other members of the organization, assigning research tasks to their internal team members, and publishing out the research to select individuals in the organization.

Even though the chance of my app being used by my organization would be almost nonexistent (due to security and tech acquisition policies), I figured it would be a great opportunity to practice collecting requirements from other people and translating those into tasks I could complete.

The current plan is to use the Hapi framework to create the backend for serving the app views and API. I chose Hapi since I hadn't encountered it before but had heard that it was a reliable choice for enterprise-level applications - and I also wanted to learn more about the configuration-over-code philosophy that the Hapi team espouses.

I'll update this page as the project progresses.
