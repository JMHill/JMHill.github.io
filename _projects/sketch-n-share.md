project: sketch-n-share

This project (including the goofy name) is definitely subject to a lot of change in the near future - it was another project spawned from my time taking the Thinkful node.js course. In the course, we used it as a tool for tinkering with websockets via socket.io.

The ultimate plan, I think, would be to create an app where you can quickly spin up a unique instance and share with another person via url, kind of like CodePen or jsfiddle.
