While my original jekyll/GitHub Pages site was a fun, low-overhead way to get started with my blog and portfolio, I've become more interested in designing more of a "home of my own" on the web. I'll be writing about this more, but I'm currently trying to finish out work on my very own lightweight MERN (*M*ongoDB, *E*xpress.js, *R*eact, *N*ode.js) application that will serve as a content management system for my new site. I was attracted to React from the get-go, as it provides a great learning opportunity for experimenting with some light functional programming concepts, while also making it easy to design component-based UI systems. More info coming soon.
