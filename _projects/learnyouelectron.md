I've been attending the nodeschool meetup in Rosslyn VA since about the middle of 2015. If you're not familiar with [nodeschool][nodeschool], it's an awesome organization that provides open source workshops (distributed as npm modules) that individuals can work through on their own or with mentors at meetups hosted around the world.

Nodeschool has a core sequence of workshops designed to teach you the basics of node.js, but there is also a growing library of "electives" that cover everything from functional programming to backend and frontend frameworks.

I'm working with a few other students to build out a workshop that'll acquaint new learners with [electron][electron], the tool created by GitHub that makes it easy to create cross platform desktop apps using node and other web technologies. Examples of apps built with electron include Slack's desktop app, as well as the Atom text editor (indeed, electron was formerly known as 'atom shell').

I can't claim to be an expert on electron, but we're going to take a shot at it in the spirit of this great [blog post by Lin Clark][lin], which reminds us that "The best time to write docs for newbies is when you've just figured something out yourself. It gives you a unique vantage point on where things are confusing." I'll update this page as the project progresses and we learn more.
