Yet another project that came out of my time in the Thinkful node.js course. This project was started early in the curriculum sequence to give me the opportunity to explore event-based and callback-based approaches to async programming in node.

Right now it's in a pretty sorry state, but I'd like to use it as a sandbox for exploring other async approaches (promises, etc) and maybe build a cool app for cataloguing and visualizing relationships between the types of music you enjoy.
