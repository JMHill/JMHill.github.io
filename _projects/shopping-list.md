Every programmer needs a good "to-do list" app to tinker with when learning new technologies. This was the project that served that purpose for me while I was taking Thinkful's node.js course.

I'm still weighing options for which technologies I'd like to explore in this little sandbox... right now, I'm thinking the first course of action will be to modularize the front-end, whether that involves trying out a new framework, or trying to create something myself.
